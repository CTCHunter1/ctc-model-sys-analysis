This is just 1 zstack lsm file from http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.44884 

The smaller files can be found in day#_small_lsm.zip. The zip file contains 1 smaller lsm file for each sample.

The bigger files are 8x8 mosaics. They are greater than 1GB. To big to be included in this archive but you can download them from the link.

This code will process the single z-stack files and the files that end in _Stitched.lsm. It will not work on the unstitched 8x8 files, which are those without the _Stitched tag in the link.
